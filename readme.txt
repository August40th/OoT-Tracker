Browser-based Item Tracker for Ocarina of Time Randomizer

Cloned from testrunnersrl.github.io/oot-tracker

I've added a complete inventory, keysanity support, and custom logic. The logic assumes the runner can do simple tricks like Mido Skip, use Hover Boots or the DM Crater Bean Heart Piece, can do fire and Water Temples without a Tunic, get into Zoras Domain with a cucco or Hover Boots, get the Lab Dive check with Iron Boots & Hookshot, Lens only required for chest mini game. 

If you notice any bugs in logic please message me on Discord: August 40th#4864
