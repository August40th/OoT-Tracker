Browser-based Item Tracker for Ocarina of Time Randomizer

Cloned from testrunnersrl.github.io/oot-tracker

I've added:
complete inventory
keysanity
skullsanity
scrubsanity
Bean, Ocarina, Egg Shuffle
Shopsanity
Cowsanity
Keysanity Fortress checks
List for trials
Grotto ER
Medigoron
List Gossip Stones (does not count available or opened gossip stones)
Indoor ER
OW mini maps

Right click items to cycle in reverse

Right click a colored box to mark it WOTH/POG (Triforce counter coming)
Click the title of an area (e.g. "Kokiri Forest") to clear any available checks, if none are available all checks in the area are marked opened (barren/foolish)

If Mixed is selected under Quest in the Setting tab (wrench bottom right)
Right click the title of a Dungeon for the MQ layout (*Note MQ checks need tweeks in logic, but are FAIRLY accurate, no MQ trials yet)

Double click an indoor location to indicate that it contains a check you can't complete yet, such as a Great Fairy Fountain

The logic assumes the runner can do simple tricks like Mido Skip, use Hover Boots or the DM Crater Bean Heart Piece, can do fire and Water Temples without a Tunic, get into Zoras Domain with a cucco or Hover Boots, get the Lab Dive check with Iron Boots & Hookshot, Lens only required for chest mini game. 

If you notice any bugs in logic please message me on Discord: August 40th#4864
