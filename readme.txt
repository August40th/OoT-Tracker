Cloned from testrunnersrl.github.io/oot-tracker

I've added:
complete inventory
keysanity, skullsanity, scrubsanity
Bean, Ocarina, Egg Shuffle
Shopsanity
Cowsanity
Keysanity & Membership Fortress checks
List trials
Grotto, Dungeon, Indoor ER
Medigoron, Carpet sale
List Gossip Stones
OW mini maps
Multi floor dungeon maps
Entrance tracker - lines connecting selected region with found paths (Big thanks to github.com/fgil90 for helping me get this working)

Right click items to cycle in reverse

Right click a colored box to mark it WOTH/POG (Triforce counter coming)
Click the title of an area (e.g. "Kokiri Forest") to clear any available checks, if none are available all checks in the area are marked opened (barren/foolish)

If Mixed is selected under Quest in the Setting tab (wrench bottom right)
Right click the title of a Dungeon to swap between mq and vanilla (*Note MQ checks need tweeks in logic, but are FAIRLY accurate, no MQ trials yet)
or Left click the bottom right corner of a key to swap between vanila or mq

The logic assumes the runner can do simple tricks like Mido Skip, use Hover Boots or the DM Crater Bean Heart Piece, can do fire and Water Temples without a Tunic, get into Zoras Domain with a cucco or Hover Boots, get the Lab Dive check with Iron Boots & Hookshot, Lens only required for chest mini game.

If Owl drops, warps, random spawns, or Overworld ER is selected clicking that check will bring up a region to assign that check to. Ex: Clicking 'Lake Owl' brings up the regions, clicking that region e.g. 'Hyrule Field' asigns the owl drop to HF. When Lake Hylia is selected a line is drawn from LH to HF square to indicate this path.

If you notice any wrong mini map coordinates or bugs in logic please message me on Discord: August 40th#4864
